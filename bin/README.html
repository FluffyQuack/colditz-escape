<h3><a name="TOC-Why-are-there-picture-black-corners"></a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

</div>
<h2><a name="TOC-GAMEPLAY"></a></h2>
<div>
<div>
<h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
<div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-can-I-use-tunnels-How-do-I-use-"></a>How can I use tunnels?<br>
How do I use the candle?<br>
How do I use the saw?<br>
How do I use the pick-axe?<br>
How do I use the shovel?<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">To use a tunnel, you must first use the
right tool to open the tunnel exit. For tunnel exits located on wood
floors, use the saw, for exits on pavement, use the pick-axe, and for
exits on grass, use the shovel. The tool will be consumed in the process<br>
To enter an open tunnel, you must use a candle (which is consumed as well).<br>
To open a tunnel exit, from within a tunnel, you need to use the
shovel, regardless of the type of ground that exit sits on. If the exit
is already open, just pressing action will do.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-What-is-required-for-a-successful-e"></a>What is required for a successful escape?<br>
How do I use the papers?<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">To successfully escape from the castle,
you will need to be in possession of German papers (those are different
from passes, which are only used with guards). If you don't have these
papers, you will be returned to the Castle<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-do-I-use-stooge-"></a>How do I use stooge?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can set stooge with prisoners, as
means of alert for guards. Once a stooge is set (STOOGE should appear in
the status bar), the focus will go back to the prisoner who set the
stooge if a guard comes close by.<br>
This can be used to warn a prisoner visiting a restricted area that a
guard is on his way. To set a stooge, make sure your prisoner is idle
and press the "Stooge" key.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-can-I-open-doors-How-do-I-use-K"></a>How can I open doors?<br>
How do I use Keys/Lock-picks?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Locked doors need to be opened with the relevant tool:<br>
- "Low Security doors" require the use of a a lock-pick<br>
- "Grade One Security doors" require a security key one<br>
- "Grade Two Security doors" require a security key two<br>
Any key used is immediately consumed<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-do-I-use-stones-"></a>How do I use stones?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Stones are used to slow down guards
that have entered a running pursuit. If guards are running after you,
using a stone will make them revert to a walking pursuit, thus giving you a
chance to escape.<br>
To use a stone, make sure it is selected in your inventory and press the action key<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-What-is-the-fatigue-bar-used-for-Ho"></a>What is the fatigue bar used for?<br>
How do I use sleep?<br>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Walking, running and especially
crawling increase your fatigue. The fatigue level is also increased
with every game hour that pass.<br>
 Once the fatigue bar reaches its max level, you will no longer be able to run.<br>
To reduce fatigue, you must return to your quarters to sleep. Once in your starting room, press the "Sleep" key to go to bed. <br>
Note that you can only sleep in your own bed.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-can-I-use-uniforms-"></a>How can I use uniforms?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you find a guard's uniform, you can
change into it to try to fool the guards. To use a uniform, simply
select it in your inventory and press the action key.<br>
 Note however that guards are suspiscious by nature and will ask for a pass if they don't recognize your face.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-do-I-use-a-pass-"></a>How do I use a pass?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The pass is used, when you are wearing
a German uniform, and are intercepted by a guard. Unless you can
provide a pass then, you will be sent to prison. A pass is immediately
consumed.<br>
In the enhanced version of the game, guards do remember when they have
seen a pass, and will not ask you again. A guard that has previously
seen your pass will be identified with a small pass icon.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-How-do-I-use-the-rifle-"></a>How do I use the rifle?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Just like in the original game, the
rifle is not used for anything in this game. <span>Our reverse engineering of the original game uncovered no use for the rifle whatsoever. </span>One can only speculate
what the developers had meant the rifle to be used for when they designed the game.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-Are-there-other-any-items-available"></a>Are there other any items available in the game?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you cheated, are really lucky, or somehow found a bug, you might also find a stethoscope or a prisoner's uniform in the game.<br>
The prisoner's uniform allows you to change back into prisoner's clothes (duh), which is pretty much useless.<br>
The stethoscope was not used in the original game.
<br>
</div>
</div>
<h3>
Are there any cheat modes?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Well, who knows...<br>
</div>
<h3>What does turning "Enhancements" on do in the options menu?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Enhancement menu adds a set of feature that I felt were missing from the original game:<br>
The first enhancement, which is also called  "opt_enhanced_guards"  in config.xml,  make the guards in the immediate vicinity remember when they've seen a pass from a prisoner in uniform, and thus get fooled by that prisoner if they see him again. It will also make their behaviour a bit more human after they caught with a prisoner.<br>
The second enhancement ("opt_enhanced_tunnels" in config.xml) restricts the field of vision when moving in tunnels, which makes tunnel handling a bit more challenging.<br>
Enhancements can only be turned on if "Original Mode" is not active. <br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>GAME ISSUES<br>
</h2>
<h3>Why are there picture/black corners onscreen?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This version of the game was ported primarily for the PSP (which is also why the base resolution of the game
is 480x272), so we tried to use as much screen real estate as possible.
However, the original game was not designed for widescreen, and as
such, some "tiles" would be  missing around the screen corners, when moving on
the exterior map. As this would have had a detrimental effect on the
estethics of the game, we chose to hide them using
"picture corners".<br>
<br>
</div>
<h3>I can't save the game! / Save and Load are disabled</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This
is because you enabled the original game mode in the options. The original
game did not have a save/load feature, and therefore those features,
along with any other enhancements, are disabled when "original mode" is
on. To disable "original mode", and re-enable game saves, go to the
options menu. Of course, when you do that, you'll probably also find out if you're a chicken...</div>
<h3>I get an "Integrity check failure" when starting the game<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This means that the data files you are using differ in content from the ones expected by the game, which can happen if:<br>
- Your files are corrupted =&gt; download the binaries again<br>
-
You manually changed the data files =&gt; if you want to mod the game,
you should start by recompiling the source and remove the MD5 checks.</div>
<h3>(PSP) Whoa, I never realized the remanence on the PSP was so bad! /
The game smears a lot &amp; doesn't look too good on older PSPs</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Indeed. Please address your complaints to "Hey Sony, it sure took you a while to put a <b>decent</b> screen on the PSP, 1-7-1 Konan, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-0075, Japan"<br>
More
seriously though, the original game was developed for screens (CRT)
that, unlike LCD, were a lot more responsive and allowed greater
freedom in the choice of palette &amp; contrast. Not much can be done
here, apart changing all the palettes. Gotta give props to the actual
PSP game artists, who have had to put up with the kind of creativity
restriction introduced by Sony when they tried to make a quick buck by
using such a poor response time LCD on the PSPs 1000 &amp; 2000... <br>
</div>
<h3>(Windows) The Intro video (aperture.avi) does not play<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

Make sure your video codecs are up to date. You might want to download and install the <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">K-lite codec pack</a>.</div>
<h3>(Windows) I get a "winXAudio2Init: failed to init XAudio2 engine" / "Could not initialize audio" error message</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
Windows version uses the latest DirectX audio engine. Please make sure
you have the latest DirectX runtime installed (which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">from here</a>).<br>
</div>
<h3>(Windows) The game doesn't run / runs too slow on my Windows platform!</h3>
<ol><li>If
you're using an embedded GPU (eg. Intel motherboard GPU), chances are
the graphics extensions required to play the game (like 16 bit little
endian GRAB textures) will not be present, and you will get a white
screen</li>
<li>Check that your monitor refresh rate is at least 50Hz.
If you run the game with a 24Hz refresh rate for instance (eg, on an
HTPC), the game speed will be bound by that frequency, no matter how
fast your CPU/GPU are.</li>
<li>If you are using HQ2X for graphics
smoothing on Windows (with a GPU cards that supports OpenGL 2.0), the
GPU shader filter might increase your CPU usage =&gt; disable GFX
smoothing.<br>
</li>
<li>Try to update to the latest DirectX. Tests
showed that there can be a drastic improvement in speed between using
DirectX 9 and DirectX 10</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Our
tests show that the the game should be playable at full speed on a P4
2.0 GHz Windows XP platform, with a decent nVidia or ATI graphics card
and DirectX 10.<br>
Note that you can use the '#' key on windows to display the game's current FPS.<br>
</div>
<h2>DATA FILES<br>
</h2>
<h3>Why didn't you provide the data files in the first release?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For potential legal reasons. However, since potential copyright holders have not manifested themselves, I will now consider the original game and data as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Abandonware</a> and provide the required data files along with the binaries.<br>
</div>
<h3><a name="TOC-Where-can-I-obtain-the-data-files-t"></a>Where can I obtain alternate data files?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I am not aware of any alternate data files for the game. However, if you want to replace the files provided with the current binaries, a search for ADF (Amiga Disk File) images of <b>Escape From Colditz</b>
in <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=kV0&amp;q=%22escape+from+colditz%22+download&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" target="_blank">any search engine</a> should direct you to original disk dumps. <br>
You can then extract the data files listed on the home page from the ADF image. You can use the Windows version of the
unadf executables (preferably staticunadf.exe) from the binw32.zip archive at <a href="http://lclevy.free.fr/adflib/adflib.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lclevy.free.fr/adflib/adflib.html</a><br>
<br>
<b>To extract the files:</b><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ol><li>Extract the files from binw32.zip to a temporary directory</li>
<li>Extract the .adf file from, the compressed ADF image you downloaded to another temporary directory.<br>
</li>
<li>Create
a new directory (this is required because unadf does not create a
subdirectory when extracting the files). Or you can use the directory
where you extracted "Colditz Escape"<br>
</li>
<li>Copy the
"staticunadf.exe" executable as well as the .adf file (eg: "Escape from
Colditz (1990)(Digital Magic)(M4)[cr SKR][FIXED GALAHAD].adf") to the
directory above.<br>
</li>
<li>From a command prompt, navigate to the directory where you have theses 2 files and run the command:<br>
staticunadf yourfile.adf (eg: staticunadf Escape from Colditz (1990)(Digital Magic)(M4)[cr SKR][FIXED GALAHAD].adf)</li>
<li>You should now have access to the required data files.<br>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>I can't seem to have COLDITZ-LOADER in the files I extracted! How can I make the game work?<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Most
of the ADF versions found on the internet don't come with the&nbsp;
COLDITZ-LOADER file, but instead with SKR_COLD, which is the compressed
version of COLDITZ-LOADER.<br>
The game engine is smart enough to detect this, and automatically uncompress and create COLDITZ-LOADER if  SKR_COLD is found.<br>
Thus you only need to provide <b>either</b>  SKR_COLD (compressed version) <i><b>or</b></i> COLDITZ_LOADER (uncompressed version) to run the game initially.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<div><br>
<h2>FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS<br>
</h2>
<h3>Do you plan to release new/custom game maps?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Not at this stage. This would require a map editor, which I haven't any plans for yet. However, with the source code being available, if you really want, you could probably create a map editor yourself. <br>
</div>
<h3>Do you plan to port the game to Linux/MacOS/some other OS?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A definitive no.<br>
The main reason this port was done was because it was challenging to:<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ol><li>Reverse Engineer the Amiga version to get a complete understanding of the game</li>
<li>Create a port that would be compatible with 2 very different architectures, i.e. the PSP (gcc based through the PSP SDK) and Windows (Visual Studio)<br>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">After completing the above, porting Colditz Escape to Linux or MacOS does not really represent a challenge, so I'm not planning to push it further.<br>
You do have complete access to  the source however, so if you want to port it to any other platform, you're more than welcome (as long as your port  satisfies the GPL v3 conditions).<br>
</div>

</div>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I am a former employee from a well know technological company called A...E. <br>
In the not so distant past, because some "Artificial Intelligence" went a bit berserk there, I decided it was probably a good time for a career change... Since then, I have been spending part of my days developing and exploring challenging endeavours. Some of it includes reverse engineering on the best computing platform ever: the Amiga.<br>
</div>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">As the intro motto says, I am pretty much doing this because I can, and because it is challenging. <br>
I would of course have preferred doing a port of the classic Amiga game "Another World", by Eric Chahi, which has to be the best video game ever, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_%28video_game%29#Unofficial_ports" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some other people beat me to it</a> (and then got into some unfortunate legal problems), and who wants to be second? This is why I settled down for this nice alternate reverse engineering project.<br>
I also wanted to find out how much effort goes into the development of a game (answer: A LOT MORE than you can ever imagine!), as well as find out if I could ever complete a decent-sized project on my own.<br>
</div>
<h3>Why did you pick Escape From Colditz?</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Well, while I do like the game, I can't pretend that there aren't scores of other Amiga games of the same era that are much better, or even more fun to play. <br>
However, this game was fairly original for the time, with some innovative features (why don't palettes gradually change to mark the passage of time on any modern games btw?!?) and has that universal "Prison Break" appeal which I think still makes it compelling almost 20 years later. <br>
 I also have  fond memories of nights I spent, back in 1992, exploring the virtual castle, which at the time I thought was huge, from top to bottom, especially as the general game difficulty and the lack of gamesaves made such an attempt quite a feat indeed, plus, ever since I bought a PSP, I had been thinking: "Wouldn't it be cool to be able to play Escape From Colditz on that machine?"<br>
This is why, when curiosity finally got the better of it, and I decided I actually wanted to understand the workings of the game (while having a great time doing some reverse engineering on the best computer ever!), this whole Colditz Escape project started...<br>
