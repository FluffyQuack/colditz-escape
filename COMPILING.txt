  Colditz Escape - Rewritten Engine for "Escape From Colditz"


WINDOWS (Visual Studio 2017):
=============================

If running Windows 8 or later, you shouldn't have to install anything special.

If not running Windows 8 or later, you will need to download and install the
latest DirectX SDK, which should be listed at:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
This provides: 
- X2Audio libs: X3DAudio.lib (as well as xaudio2.h)
- DirectShow movie player lib: strmiids.lib

Make sure the relevant directories for DX and the Windows SDK are set in
Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories

Optional 
- You can update the GLSL zoom shader(s), with the static version of the Glew
  library from: http://glew.sourceforge.net/


PSP (PSP SDK):
==============

For PSP you will need the following libraries:
- pspgl (which includes glut)
- pmp 
- expat

precompiled versions of expat (libexpat.a) and pmp (libpmp.a) are provided in
the libs/ directory. Any recent version of the PSP SDK should come with pspGL.


COMMON (optional):
==================

If you want to update Expat, you'll need to recompile libexpatMT.lib (WIN) / 
libexpat.a (PSP) and on Windows, you must add XML_STATIC in the C/C++ 
PreProcessor Definitions. 
You will also need to set the Multi-threaded (/MT) static flag instead of 
Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) in Configuration Properties -> C/C++
-> Code Generation -> Runtime Library
Precompiled versions of these libraries are provided in the libs/ directory

Important note: Because I'll be darned before I agree with the XML comitee's 
extreme shortsightedness that some chars in [00-7F] should be illegal, 
especially when we want to define our input keys in the XML conf file, the 
libexpat we use was *TWEAKED* to accept ANY [00-7F] char without barfing.
To do that, the asciitab.h file of libexpat had all its BT_NONXML changed to 
BT_OTHER before compiling.

If you don't want to have to tweak expat, you can modifie eschew.c to convert 
integer strings to unsigned char rather than simply read the value, and modify 
the config.xml

The Expat sources can be found it at: 
http://nds.cmamod.com/psp/Expat.2.01.win32_msys_bin.zip
For PSP recompilation, use the expat_config.h in extras/
