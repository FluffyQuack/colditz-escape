  Colditz Escape! - Rewritten Engine for "Escape From Colditz"

	For glut, you need the dll in the exec location or system32
	and to compile, you need:
	- glut32.lib in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib
	- glut.h in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include\gl 
	
	The libs and header can be had from http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glutdlls37beta.zip

	For expat, you need libexpatMT.lib (WIN)/libexpat.a (PSP) and on Windows, you must add XML_STATIC in 
	the C/C++ PreProcessor Definitions. You will also need to set the Multi-threaded (/MT) static flag 
	instead of Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) in Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation ->
	Runtime Library
	
	Conf
	I believe I downloaded my Expat from http://nds.cmamod.com/psp/Expat.2.01.win32_msys_bin.zip
	For PSP recompilation, use the expat_config.h in extras/

	Important note: Because I'll be darned before I agree with the XML comitee's extreme shortsightedness 
	that some chars in [00-7F] should be illegal, especially when we want to define our input keys in the
	XML conf file, the libexpat we use was *TWEAKED* to accept ANY [00-7F] char without barfing.
	To do that, the asciitab.h file of libexpat had all its BT_NONXML changed to BT_OTHER before compiling.
	
	If you don't want to have to tweak expat, you can modifie eschew.c to convert integer strings to 
	unsigned char rather than simply read the value, and modify the config.xml

  For PSP you will need
  pmplib
