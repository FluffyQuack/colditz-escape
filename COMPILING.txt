  Colditz Escape! - Rewritten Engine for "Escape From Colditz"


WINDOWS:

For glut, you need the dll in the exec location or system32
and to compile, you need:
- glut32.lib in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib
- glut.h in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include\gl 
The libs and header can be had from:
  http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glutdlls37beta.zip

For the GLSL zoom shader(s), you will also need the static version of the
Glew library (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

You will also need the following DirectX libraries, as highlighted at the 
beginning of main.c:
- X2Audio libs: X3DAudio.lib
- DirectShow movie player lib: strmiids.lib


PSP:

For PSP you will need the following libraries:
- pmplib 
- pspgl (which includes glut)

Please be mindful that If you try to use a PSPGL that relies on VFPU (i.e. need 
to add -lpspvfpu in your Makefile), the game will be SUPER-SLOW!!!
Don't know what the heck has changed in the VFPU based versions of PSPGL, but it
sure didn't improve 2D performance!
To get *proper* GL speed, you MUST use the 2005.12.10 version of the PSPGL, 
which can be obtained from:
# http://hg.goop.org/pspgl/jsgf?cmd=archive;node=working;type=zip or the one 
included with this source in extras/pspgl


EXPAT:

For expat, you need libexpatMT.lib (WIN)/libexpat.a (PSP) and on Windows, you 
must add XML_STATIC in the C/C++ PreProcessor Definitions. You will also need to
set the Multi-threaded (/MT) static flag instead of Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) in 
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library
Prcompiled versions of thse libraries are provided in the libs/ directory

Important note: Because I'll be darned before I agree with the XML comitee's 
extreme shortsightedness that some chars in [00-7F] should be illegal, 
especially when we want to define our input keys in the XML conf file, the 
libexpat we use was *TWEAKED* to accept ANY [00-7F] char without barfing.
To do that, the asciitab.h file of libexpat had all its BT_NONXML changed to 
BT_OTHER before compiling.

If you don't want to have to tweak expat, you can modifie eschew.c to convert 
integer strings to unsigned char rather than simply read the value, and modify 
the config.xml

If you want to recompile Expat, you can find it at: 
http://nds.cmamod.com/psp/Expat.2.01.win32_msys_bin.zip
For PSP recompilation, use the expat_config.h in extras/
