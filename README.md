_Colditz Escape!_ is a rewritten game engine for the classic "Escape From Colditz" Amiga game.
In this game, you control a set of four prisoners of war trying to escape from the infamous Colditz Castle WWII prison.

The original game, created by Mike Halsall and John Law (with intro music by BjÃ¸rn Lynne), was published in 1991
by Digital Magic Software. This new version, which allows you to play the game on the PSP and Windows platforms,
has been reverse engineered from the original Amiga game engine and is released under a GPL v3 license.
